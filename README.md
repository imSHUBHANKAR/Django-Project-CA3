Install pipenv to create virtual environment for python. (`brew` should install `pip3` for you when you install python3.)
```
pip3 install pipenv
```
Use pipenv to install django which version is 2.1
```
pipenv install django==2.1
```
Go to your virtual environment. You need to in this virtual environment to be able to use the particular version of django that you install. 
```
pipenv shell

run the django server. 
```
python manage.py runserver
```

#### API
Make sure your `url` for `POST` method in file [tokenfield.js](https://github.com/sumin3/Recipe-Django-App/blob/master/static/scripts/tokenfield.js) line `32` and your browser `url` are the same. (In this case, the url should be http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## Database
- recipeItem and ingredientItem models both defined in file [models.py](https://github.com/sumin3/Recipe-Django-App/blob/master/ingredient/models.py)


Go to your virtual environment.
```
pipenv shell
```
Inorder to interact with the models, we need to go to python shell.
```
python manage.py shell
```
Import the models 
```
>>> from ingredient.models import recipeItem
>>> from ingredient.models import ingredientItem
```
- To get all the object in the model
```
>>> recipeItem.objects.all()
```
```
>>> ingredientItem.objects.all()
```
- To get one object of the model
```
recipeItem.objects.all()[index number]

>>> recipeItem.objects.all()[0] //get the first object
```
- To get the value of the object. (`name` is one filed of the recipeItem model. You can change it to different fileds) Want to know what fileds you can use?  look at the model file [models.py](https://github.com/sumin3/Recipe-Django-App/blob/master/ingredient/models.py) 
```
>>> recipeItem.objects.all()[0].name
```
- To add new ingredient
```
>>> i1 = ingredientItem(name="potato", property="vegetable", img_url="image-url-link")
```
Save it!
```
>>> i1.save()
```
- To add new recipe (use `#` to separate the ingredients and steps)
```
>>> r1 = recipeItem(name="recipe-name", ingredients="ingredient1#ingredient2#ingredient3", directions="step1#step2#step3", img_url="image-url-link")
>>> r1.save()
```
Associate the recipe `r1` with a ingredient `i1`:
```
>>> r1.list_ingredient.add(i1)
```
- To update a value
```
>>> i1.name = "beef"
>>> i1.save(update_fields = ['name'])
```
